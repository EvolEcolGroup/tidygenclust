\item{reset}{a boolean used to reset the virtual environment. Only set
to TRUE if you have a broken virtual environment that you want to reset.}

\description{
\code{tidygenclust} relies on the \code{admxiture} and on python packages \code{fastmixture}
and \code{clumppling} for a number of
functionalities. We use \code{reticulate} to install them in conda
environments. As their dependencies are incompatible, we use two separate
conda environment, \code{ctidygenclust} (for \code{fastmixture} and \code{admixture}) and
\code{cclumppling} (for \code{clumppling}).
For each tool, default to the latest tested version of
these packages that have been tested to work with \code{tidegenclust}. It is
possible to provide a more recent github commit for a specific tool, but
this might lead to incompatibilities and errors.
